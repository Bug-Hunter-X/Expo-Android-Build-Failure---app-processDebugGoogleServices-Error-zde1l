This error occurs when using the Expo CLI to build an Android app. The build process fails with the error message: `Execution failed for task ':app:processDebugGoogleServices`.  The issue arises because the `google-services.json` file is either missing from the `android/app` directory, improperly formatted, or contains incorrect configuration.  This file is crucial for integrating Firebase services into your app.
