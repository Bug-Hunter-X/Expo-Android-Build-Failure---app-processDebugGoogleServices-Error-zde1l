The solution to this problem is to ensure the `google-services.json` file exists and contains the correct configuration. Here's a breakdown of the steps:

1. **Obtain `google-services.json` from Firebase:** Log in to your Firebase console, select your project, and download the `google-services.json` file from the project settings for your Android app.

2. **Place the file:** Put the downloaded `google-services.json` file into the `android/app` directory of your Expo project.

3. **Clean and rebuild:** Run `expo prebuild` followed by `expo build:android`.  This ensures a clean build process and helps avoid potential caching issues.

By following these steps, the build process should now complete successfully.
